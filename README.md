Welcome to my Phase 2 final project for Flatiron School!

I was tasked with making a single page application using at least 5 components with React. I made a simple blogging site, which features a home page, a controlled form to write blog posts and blog feed, which displays all saved blog posts. This app works in conjunciton with json server to maintain its data. 

To write a post, simply click on the "Write" tab on the navbar or go to /write. The controlled form with capture your writing and, when submitted, send it to the json database. You will then be progmammatically routed to the blog feed, which will display your post!

On the blog feed, which can also be navigated to through the Blog Feed tab in the nav bar or by going to /blog, you can also delete any posts, and they will be removed from the feed and from the json database.

Thank you for checking out my project!


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
